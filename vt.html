        <h2>TRAVEL BY CAR</h2>
        
       <p>A 4 hour and 22 min. drive is all it takes to get you to Magic Mountain.  Here is a great site to plan your trip -- https://www.rome2rio.com/s/New-York/Magic-Mountain-Ski-Are </p>
       
       <h2>TRAVEL BY TRAIN OR BUS</h2>
       
       <p> Rail is always your best bet.  Check out the AMTRAK at www.amtrack.com for details in planning your trip from Penn Station to Rensselaer, VT. </p> 
       
       <h2>AIR TRAVEL</h2>
       
       <p>Flying may not be your best bet to getting to Magic Mountain.  Planes leaving from La Guardia Airport land in Manchester, VT and you have to take a bus from there.  Planes leaving from Newark, NJ land in Albany, NY with (you guessed it?) another bus travel to the mountain.   Both ways add a considerable amount of time, at least 1 to possibly 4 hrs. In additional travel time. Best bet, either drive or take the rail.  In the long run it saves time and money.</p>
