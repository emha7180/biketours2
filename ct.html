      <h1>Mount Southington</h1>
      <p>In the 1960s, when boots were leather and laced and skis were long, Dr. Harold Richman returned from a ski trip in Vermont with his wife Barbara, 
      inspired to build a family-oriented ski area in central Connecticut. 
      After looking around for just the right spot – aesthetic and convenient, with land and water resources – 
      he discovered a dairy farm in Southington that was for sale.
      The site was perfect.
Dr. Richman partnered with other members of his family along with the Palmisano family, 
of Bristol, CT, and other local investors. Together they purchased the dairy farm, 
carved out trails, installed lifts and snowmaking equipment and began to create the Mount Southington Ski Area of today.
     </p>
     <p>Mount Southington Ski Area has always enjoyed hosting and supporting our community by offering our services to wonderful organizations such as - CT Children’s Medical Center, 
     Nutmeg Big Brothers Big Sisters, CT Special Olympics, 
     and Leaps of Faith, along with many others. 
     Our staff – many of whom have been with us for years – are passionate about making every day a great day for the skiers and snowboarders on our slopes.
1964 to today … over 50 years of growth and change! If you’ve shared our journey, thank you for being a part of it.  
If now is the time to begin, we invite you and your family to visit our slopes, 
take a lesson or two, and make memories of your own with us!

      <h1>Woodbury Ski Area</h1>
      <p>Woodbury Ski Area is located in Woodbury, Connecticut. 
      This small ski area is in New England. The skiing and snow tubing operations are serviced by a chairlift and multiple surface lifts. 
      Local residents refer to it as "Rod's" after its owner, Olympic skier Rod Taylor. 
      True locals refer to it as "Woodbury Rock & Gravel" after its previous name "Woodbury Ski and Racket" because snow coverage is often inadequate and the terrain can be damaging to skis and boards; recommended: use beaters or rentals.
      Taylor opened the resort in 1972. 
      Taylor took pride in Woodbury being the first ski area in Connecticut to open each season.
